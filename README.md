Hello!! 
Thank you for visiting my code repository. Kindly traverse through the repository to check out the sample codes in Python, MATLAB and STATA. 

Navigating through the repository is pretty straightforward. If you are here then feel free to check out data cleaning and analytics files. 
This repo has three folders and each folder is for MATLAB, Python and STATA. Pyhton and STATA folders have data cleaning and analytics files. In MATLAB folder, I have added dynamic programming files. I have also added a python scraper file. I have written a lot of scrapers in the past and this is the most recent one. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the repo, please feel free to write an email at niranjan.kumar_ma23@ashoka.edu.in.
