Hello!! 
Thank you for visiting my code repository. Kindly traverse through the repository to check out the sample codes in Python, MATLAB and STATA. 
Navigating through the repository is pretty straightforward. If you are here then feel free to check out data cleaning and analytics files. 
This repo has five folders and each folder contains code in MATLAB, Python and STATA. Pyhton and STATA folders have data cleaning and analytics files. In MATLAB folder, I have added dynamic programming files. Labor Economics Project folder has all the do files for tthe written term paper. I have also added webscraper folder which has multiple scraping files. I have written a lot of scrapers in the past and due to folder size limitation, I am sharing a couple of recent sourcecodes. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the repo, please feel free to write an email at niranjan.kumar@alumni.ashoka.edu.in
